Task activation maps were generated for each task and individual (see task_processing folder)

**Specialized Network Responses**
1. Average per-network task activation z-values for language, theory of mind, episodic projection were computed and plotted (network_responses.m)

**Control Network Responses**
1. Individual network-level responses for cognitive control tasks were computed (network_responses_write.m)
2. Individual network-level ressponses for cognitive control tasks were plotted (network_responses_plot_control.m)

**Control Network Correlation Matrix**
1. A correlation matrix of within/across individual task responses was calculated (pfc_task_correlation.m).
