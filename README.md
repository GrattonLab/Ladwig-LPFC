This repository contains MATLAB scripts used to conduct analyses from Ladwig et al., 2025, Precision fMRI reveals densely interdigitated network patches with conserved motifs in the lateral prefrontal cortex.

Data: Data from 10 highly sampled individuals will be made publicly available at Open Neuro upon publication.

Scripts: All analyses can be replicated using the scripts below, which are organized by topic. 

Network Composition (Figure 1, Supplemental Figures S6, S15B,C)

Border Density (Figure 2, 4D Supplemental Figures S8-S12, S15D-G) 

Split Half Reliability (Supplemental Figures S4,S5) 

Task Responses (Figures 5-8, Supplemental Figures S14, S17) 

Border Activations (Figure 8)
